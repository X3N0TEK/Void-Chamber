🌌 Void Chamber

Void Chamber is a cosmic, alien-themed game of chance inspired by the human ritual of Russian Roulette. You enter the Chamber not for glory, but to face the eternal hunger of the Void. Each cycle is a wager of existence — survive, and the Chamber acknowledges your defiance. Fail, and you are claimed by the Abyss.

🕹️ Gameplay Overview

The player faces the Void Chamber, an ancient alien ritual device.

The Chamber spins, hiding the Oblivion Seed among empty husks.

On your turn, you must choose to:

Summon → Pull the Chamber’s Call and face fate.

Pass → Refuse the Call, pushing risk into the next cycle (if rules permit).

Survive enough Cycles and resonate through fate itself.

Fall to the Oblivion Seed, and the Void claims you.

🛸 A Final Word

"Few enter the Void Chamber.
Fewer still emerge.
Will you resonate… or be claimed?"
