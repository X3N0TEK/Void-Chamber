# 🌌 Void Chamber

Void Chamber is a cosmic, alien-themed game of chance inspired by the human ritual of Russian Roulette. You enter the Chamber not for glory, but to face the eternal hunger of the Void. Each cycle is a wager of existence — survive, and the Chamber acknowledges your defiance. Fail, and you are claimed by the Abyss.

# ⚡ Core Concepts

- Cycles (Total Shots): The count of all Chamber turns endured.

- Oblivion Seed (Bullet): The hidden shard of annihilation.

- Summon (Pull Trigger): When you call upon the Chamber to decide.

- Pass: Deny the Chamber once — but beware, the Void remembers.

- Currency – Shards: Earned fragments of fate, used to unlock perks.

# 🎯 Features

- Alien-inspired narrative flavor text for every action. Tension-filled risk & reward gameplay.
- Perks & Unlocks (e.g. Lucky Trigger, Double XP, Cheap Pass, High Roller).
- Thematic progression currency (Shards) to buy permanent upgrades.
- Designed to be expanded into graphical or terminal-based versions.

🛸 A Final Word

"Few enter the Void Chamber.
Fewer still emerge.
Will you resonate… or be claimed?"
